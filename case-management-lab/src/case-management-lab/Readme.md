<h1>This project is for a hands-on lab for Creating and Deploying Lambdas with API Gateway using Infrastructre as Code.</h1>

This course was created for a hands-on lab presented by [slalom_build](https://www.slalombuild.com/).

At the end of this lab, you will be able to write and configure AWS Lambdas, create an API Gateway, and connect your Lambdas to a DynamoDB instance. We will deploy these assets using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 

The starter code is in the `main` branch. It includes all dependencies required. The completed code is in the `in-person-lab-complete` branch.
